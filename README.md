Created 2 class with the following structure:

1 - ProductsManager Class that is responsible for managing products.
    a) each product has the following properties: id,title,photo,category, price, stoc. 

2 - UsersManager Class that is responsible for managing users
    a) each user has the following properties: id, photo, email,password, rol

In both cases, there is private variable that stores the data from products/users into an array. 



In order to test both classes:
Users: node usersManager.js
ProductManager: node usersManager.js
